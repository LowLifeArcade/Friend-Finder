Notes 
jsx is javascript but it looks like html

class from html doesn't work though because jsx is javascript and class is a reserved word, so we have to use className where we would use class in html

in js file you can give a prop to tag and can then use prop in another file

You need React active to use JSX so import React from 'react'

when 
const Card = () => {
    return(
        <div></div>
    )
}
You can only return one thing. The one in the div.

for 
import {people} from './people';

you have "destructure" it with {} because it doesn't say export default at the bottom of the people.js file

key props in the cards helps so that when the virtual dom deletes something it knows it is just that thing and doesn't have to reevaluate the whole page

if returning on multiple lines use ()

Props are things that come out of STATE

STATE is the description of the App

State comes form a parent and becomes prop when a child receives it

At the end of 212 video he talks about weird things you must do for State

revist 215 about props.children
scroll as an example
